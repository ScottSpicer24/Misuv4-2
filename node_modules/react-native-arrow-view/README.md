![v1.gif](.github/v1.gif)

Install
-------
```bash
npm install --save react-native-arrow-view
```
or
```bash
yarn add react-native-arrow-view
```

For iOS you should add to your Podspec next line:
```ruby
pod 'React-ART', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/Libraries/ART'
```
and run `pod install` after that

Example
-------

Add `ArrowView` to render function, pass to it absolute coordinates for drawing it self position.
```js
import { ArrowView } from 'react-native-arrow-view'

render() {
  return(
    <ArrowView
      from={{ x: 0, y: 0 }}
      to={{ x: 100, y: 100 }}
      // dash={[5, 10]} // optional: for define [dashLength, dashGap] 
      // color={color} // optional: color of arrow
      // curveDelta={curveDelta} // optional: for add more accuaracy
      // width={width} // optional: width of arrow lines
    />
  )
}
```

If you dont know coordinates of your view, you can use `Measurable` component, that can calculate it for you
```js
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'
import { ArrowView, Measurable } from 'react-native-arrow-view'

render() {
  return(
    <View>
      <ArrowView
        from={this.state.fromCoordinates}
        to={this.state.toCoordinates}
      />

      <Measurable onMeasure={(x: number, y: number, width: number, height: number) => {
        this.setState({
          fromCoordinates: {
            x, y, width, height
          }
        })
      }}>
        <Text>From</Text>
      </Measurable>

      <Measurable onMeasure={(x: number, y: number, width: number, height: number) => {
        this.setState({
          toCoordinates: {
            x, y, width, height
          }
        })
      }}>
        <Text>To</Text>
      </Measurable>
    </View>
  )
}
```

Also, you can modify your arrow position for more flexible configuration.
